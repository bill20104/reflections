1. How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	Viewing a diff between two versions let me
    find a bug easier, because we know 
    bugs must be inside the change part of versions.

    When I find a bug, I can checkout each commit
    from most recent one to oldest one, run it,
    and the first commit which didn't have the bug,
    we know, its previous commit is 
    the commit which first introduced the bug.
    Then we can compare the difference 
    between the two commits, we can find 
    the bug.
